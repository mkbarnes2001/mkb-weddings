## Managing Your Wedding Photo Galleries

### How It Works

Your gallery is organized by **venues** (types of wedding locations). Each venue can contain multiple photos. Your three uploaded photos have been organized into:

1. **Beach & Coastal Weddings** - 2 photos
2. **Historic Venues & Estates** - 1 photo

### Adding New Venues

1. Click **"Add New Venue"** in the Venue Management section
2. Fill in:
   - **Venue Name**: e.g., "Garden Estates", "Mountain Retreats"
   - **Location**: e.g., "Wine Country", "Pacific Northwest"
   - **Description**: Brief description of this venue type
   - **SEO Keywords**: Comma-separated keywords like "garden wedding, outdoor ceremony, botanical venue"
3. Click **"Save Venue"**

### Adding Photos to a Venue

1. **Select a venue** by clicking on it in the venue list
2. Click **"Add Photo"**
3. Fill in the photo details:

   **Image Source:**
   - For images uploaded through Figma Make chat, use: `figma:asset/[hash].png`
   - Example: `figma:asset/44af4adcce420c7bfedb84857460f6a6381ddfe3.png`
   - For images hosted elsewhere, use full URLs: `https://yoursite.com/images/photo.jpg`

   **Image Description:**
   - Write a detailed, SEO-friendly description
   - Example: "Romantic sunset ceremony at coastal venue with ocean backdrop"
   - This appears as alt text and helps with search rankings

   **Category:**
   - Ceremony
   - Reception
   - Portraits
   - Details
   - Landscape/Venue

4. Click **"Save Photo"**

### Getting Image Paths from Chat Uploads

When you upload images through the Figma Make chat interface, I'll provide you with the `figma:asset/` path. Simply copy and paste that path into the "Image Source" field in the Gallery Admin.

### Editing Photos or Venues

- **Edit Photo**: Hover over a photo and click the save icon
- **Edit Venue**: Click the save icon next to any venue name
- Make your changes and click "Save"

### Deleting Content

- **Delete Photo**: Hover over a photo and click the trash icon
- **Delete Venue**: Click the trash icon next to a venue (only works if the venue has no photos)

### How Many Photos Can I Add?

There's no limit! Add as many photos as you want to each venue. The gallery automatically organizes them into a beautiful grid layout.

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Organize by Venue Type** - Group similar wedding locations together
2. **Write Descriptive Alt Text** - Helps with SEO and accessibility
3. **Use Categories** - Makes it easier to find specific photo types later
4. **Add Keywords** - Improves search engine visibility for each venue type
5. **High-Quality Images** - Use the best resolution available for professional presentation

### Uploading Multiple Photos

To add multiple photos efficiently:

1. Upload your photos through the chat interface (one or more at a time)
2. I'll provide you with all the `figma:asset/` paths
3. Copy each path and add them through Gallery Admin one by one
4. Each photo only takes a few seconds to add!

### Viewing Your Galleries

After adding photos, click your browser's back button or navigate to the Galleries page to see your photos displayed beautifully on the public-facing site. The gallery automatically:

- Shows only venues with photos
- Creates filtering buttons for each venue
- Displays photo counts
- Enables lightbox viewing with click-to-zoom
- Applies hover effects and smooth transitions
